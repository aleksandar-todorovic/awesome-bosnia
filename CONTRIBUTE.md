# How to contribute?

Contributions to this repository are pretty straight-forward. All you have to do is to fork the project, make the changes in the `README.md` file and submit the Pull Request.

Format:

```gfm
* [title](link) - Short description.
```

If three of your Pull Requests get merged into the main repository, you will become the collaborator of the project.
